Environment
===========

Desktop

IDE
---

I'm using `Microsoft Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ as my
code editor. It's at version ``1.27.x`` at the time I write this but the product
is frequently updated so anything beyond that version should be fine.

I've installed the following extensions to aid my work:

Azure
^^^^^

* Azure Account
* Azure Resource Manager Tools
* Azure Storage
* Azure Functions
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Application Insights
* Azure Event Grid

Languages
^^^^^^^^^
* JavaScript:

    * ESLint
    * Prettier
    * Simple React Snippets

* C#
* Python

Others

* Docker
* reStructuredText
* XML Tools
